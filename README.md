# Bet9ja Web Scraper with Python: Automate Betting Data Extraction

This Python script automates the extraction of soccer betting data from **Bet9ja**. It scrapes match times, team names, and betting odds (home, draw, away) from the Bet9ja website, providing a fast and efficient way to gather betting data for further analysis.

## üìå Features

- **Efficient Scrolling**: Scrolls through the website to load and extract all match data.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Automatically detects and removes duplicate records to ensure clean datasets.

## üöÄ How It Works

The scraper visits the Bet9ja daily soccer betting page, extracts match details, and saves the data into a structured CSV format. It automatically scrolls through the available matches to capture all the required data.

### Key Steps:

1. **Browser Setup**: The script uses Selenium to initiate a browser session and navigate to the Bet9ja page.
2. **Scroll and Load**: Automatically scrolls through the page to load all the available soccer matches.
3. **Data Scraping**: Uses BeautifulSoup to extract match times, home/away teams, and betting odds.
4. **Data Storage**: Saves the extracted data in CSV format.
5. **Duplicate Handling**: Removes any duplicate records in the CSV file.

- **Python 3.x**
- **Selenium**
- **BeautifulSoup4**
- **pandas**
- **ChromeDriver** (or the appropriate driver for your browser)

Install the required packages using pip:
